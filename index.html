          <p>The jiǎozi is a common Chinese dumpling, which generally consists of minced meat and finely chopped vegetables wrapped into a piece of dough skin. Popular meat fillings include ground meat (usually pork, but can instead be beef or chicken), shrimp, and even fish. Popular mixtures include pork with Chinese cabbage, pork with garlic chives, pork and shrimp with vegetables, pork with spring onion, garlic chives with scrambled eggs. Filling mixtures will vary depending on personal tastes, region and season. Jiaozi are usually boiled, steamed or fried and continue to be a traditional dish eaten, in which people will place a coin or candy inside the Jiaozi with the meanings of obtaining a fortune or having a sweet life, on Chinese New Year's Eve, the evening before Chinese New Year, and special family reunions.</p>

There are many variations in fillings (meat or vegetarian) and preparations, though the buns are most often steamed. They are a variation of mantou from Northern China.Two types are found in most parts of China and Indonesia: Dàbāo ("big bun") and Xiǎobāo ("small bun"). A small ceramic dish for dipping the baozi is provided for vinegar or soy sauce, both of which are available in bottles at the table, along with various types of chili and garlic pastes, oils or infusions, fresh coriander and leeks, sesame oil, and other flavorings. They are popular all over China.</p>
